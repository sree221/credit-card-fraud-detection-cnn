Credit card fraud detection is a critical task for financial institutions and payment systems. With the rise in digital transactions, fraud detection systems must become more robust, scalable, and accurate. In this project, we use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. We are leveraging deep learning techniques to identify patterns in the transaction data that differentiate fraudulent transactions from legitimate ones.

This project employs a CNN model that is specifically designed to handle imbalanced datasets, which is common in fraud detection, where fraudulent transactions are much fewer than legitimate ones. SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) is used to balance the dataset before feeding it into the model. Additionally, techniques like batch normalization, dropout, and data scaling are employed to improve the accuracy of the model.

Objective:
Detect fraudulent credit card transactions using deep learning techniques.
Use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for feature extraction and classification of transactions.
Improve model performance by addressing data imbalance and scaling features.



##Key Libraries Used:
TensorFlow/Keras for building the CNN model.
Pandas for data manipulation and preprocessing.
Scikit-learn for data scaling and splitting, as well as evaluation metrics.
Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE) for balancing the dataset.
Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization.



##Model Architecture:

1D Convolutional Layers (Conv1D): Convolutional layers are used to capture the local patterns and relationships between features in a 1D structure.
Batch Normalization: Used to normalize the activations and gradients, which helps in faster training and better performance.
Dropout: To prevent overfitting, dropout layers are added with different rates to remove certain connections during training.
Max Pooling: This reduces the dimensionality of the features, summarizing the most important aspects of the features extracted by the convolutional layers.
Dense Layers: Fully connected layers for final classification. A sigmoid activation function is used to classify transactions as fraud (1) or non-fraud (0).
Optimization: Adam optimizer is used with a learning rate of 0.0001 to optimize the model.

##Conclusion:
This project demonstrates how Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can be effectively applied to credit card fraud detection by handling imbalanced data and using advanced techniques like SMOTE for data balancing and mixed precision training for computational efficiency. By using deep learning, the model can learn complex patterns in the transaction data and predict fraudulent activities with high accuracy, making it an essential tool for financial institutions and payment systems to prevent fraud.
